            <h1>Using Data Attributes for Mobile Column Titles in Responsive Tables</h1>
<p>A few years ago, I referenced <a href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/" target="_blank">a handy CSS Tricks article</a> when trying to figure out the best way to handle the display of column and cell data when displaying it in a tabular data format. In essence, the article illustrates that by changing the display property of the rows and cells, and hiding the column headings, one can use the :before pseudo element to show the column headings next to the cell content. It's a great solution that keeps the column and cell data on the same line, while stacking it into rows so the table isn't squeezed.</p>
<p>While it works great, one thing that didn't sit well was that I was putting content in CSS. If I changed the column headings in the future, I would need to change them in the :before pseudo element content property as well.</p>
<p>By using a data-title attribute in the cell of the table, the attr() function can be referenced in a CSS attribute selector that grabs the data-title to be shown in the :before pseudo element content attribute.  In re-reading the article recently, I noticed a small blurb at the bottom of the page - as well as a mention in the comments - that links to this solution, but I completely overlooked it the first time I referenced the article. I figured I would write a post on it in case it's overlooked by anyone else.</p>
<p>Here's a pen that shows a simple example of how it works.</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="briangunzenhauser" data-slug-hash="JjboOMj" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Using data-title for column headings in responsive tables">

<p>What I like about this is two-fold. One, it respects the separation of concerns and keeps content out of CSS. And two, it can keep the management of the title in one spot if using a CMS, such as ACF in Wordpress.</p>
<p>According to caniuse.com, the <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=attr" target="_blank">attr() function</a> is <em>supported for effectively all browsers for the content property</em>, so using this is a pretty safe bet.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps someone out there. If you use this and have any additional tips, or if you see anything glaringly wrong with this approach, <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">drop me a line on my contact page</a> and I'll update the article accordingly.</p>
